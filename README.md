<h2 align="left">📖 Introduction</h2>

###

<p align="left">This university project explores the Evil Twin Wi-Fi attack as part of a Network Security Protocol course.<br><br>The work combines software tools and hardware components to demonstrate how rogue access points can be deployed in a controlled lab environment, analyze their impact on wireless clients, and study detection and mitigation techniques.</p>

<h2 align="left">🔍 Overview</h2>

###

<p align="left">An Evil Twin Attack is a wireless attack technique in which an attacker sets up a rogue access point that imitates a legitimate Wi‑Fi network to trick nearby clients into connecting.<br><br>In the Network Security Protocol course, this attack was first studied from a theoretical perspective, then implemented practically using dedicated hardware devices and custom software running on a lab environment.<br><br>The primary focus of this project was on demonstrating the attack methodology itself and understanding how such threats operate in real‑world wireless scenarios.</p>

<h2 align="left">📊 Results</h2>

###

<p align="left">
  
  - The system successfully demonstrated the intended Evil Twin attack scenario within the lab environment.<br><br>
  - Due to limited time constraints and the technical complexity of integrating both hardware and software components, the implementation required intensive testing and iteration.<br><br>
  - AI-based tools were utilized as supportive resources for research, debugging, and code refinement, helping to accelerate development while maintaining academic integrity.<br><br>
  - Overall, the project met its objectives and produced reliable experimental results under constrained conditions.</p>

<h2 align="left">🛡️ Defense</h2>

###

<p align="left">Although the main focus of the project was the attack demonstration, defensive measures and user awareness were also discussed as part of the academic analysis.<br><br>
  
  <b>These included:</b><br>
  - Avoiding connection to unknown or unsecured wireless networks.<br>
  - Monitoring for duplicate or suspicious SSIDs.<br>
  - Using strong encryption standards such as WPA3.<br>
  - Deploying wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS).<br>
  - Educating users about common Wi‑Fi attack techniques.<br><br>
  <p>These practices help reduce the risk of falling victim to Evil Twin attacks in real‑world environments.</p></p>
